# Ubuntu-Post-Install

I am not good at writing scripts.  I am still learning.
This is an effort to automate some of my most common requirements when installing Ubuntu.
If you can use it - please do. If you can make it better - go ahead.

To use it - clone it, then CHMOD +X it to make it executable.  Then run it as root.
